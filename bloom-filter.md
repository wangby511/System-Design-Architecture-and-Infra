# Bloom Filter

A Bloom filter is a data structure used to detect whether an element is in a set in a time and space efficient way.

An empty Bloom filter is a bit-array of m bits, all set to 0. There are also k different hash functions, each of which maps a set element to one of the m bit positions.

To add an element, feed it to the hash functions to get k bit positions, and set all the bits at these positions to 1.

To test if an element is in the set, feed it to the hash functions to get k bit positions. If any of the bits at these positions is 0, the element is definitely not in the set. If all are 1, then the element may be in the set.

E.g.

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and if hash(key1) = {3,6,7}

Then bits array = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]

False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not.

## Explanation

Bloom filters are a probabilistic data structure for set membership testing that may yield false positives. A large bit vector represents the set. An element is added to the set by computing N hash functions of the element and setting the corresponding bits. An element is deemed to be in the set if the bits at all N of the elementâ€™s hash locations are set. Hence, a document may incorrectly be deemed to be in the set, but false negatives are impossible.

## Used Example

How to avoid crawling duplicate URLs at large scale? - Introduce a big Bit Vector and a few hash functions.

Cassandra uses Bloom filters to determine whether an SSTable has data for a particular row.

## Conclusion

A bloom filter is a data structure (similar to hash table) designed to tell you, rapidly and memory-efficiently, whether an element is present in a set.

It could be false positive, but false negatives are impossible.
