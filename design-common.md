## Common Non-Functional Requirements

Reliability - probability a system will fail in a given period. A distributed system is considered reliable if it keeps delivering its services even when one or several of its software or hardware components fail.

Scalability - capability of a system to handle or manage growing and increasing demands or requests.

Availability - simple measure of the percentage of time that a system, service, or a machine remains operational under normal conditions.

## Common Component

Use a queue - de-coupling the services and act as a buffer in case throttling

## Normal Follow Ups

Scaling database - vertical vs horizontal

SQL or NoSQL

Leader-follower replica

Database Sharding - hotkey issue and handling mechanisms
