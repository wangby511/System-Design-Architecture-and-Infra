# Redis

Redis is an in-memory data structure store that offers a rich set of features. It is useful as a cache, database, message broker, and queue.

Redis supports data structures like list, set, hash and can store values of up to 512MB in size. So Redis is good at doing key => SOME_OBJECT.

Redis has lots of great features and is very fast, but limited to one core.
